The Yale Face Database B consists of single light source images of 10 subjects, each seen in different poses and illumination conditions. In the provided form the database is divided into 5 subsets. In subset 0 the subject is illuminated by an almost frontal light source, while for subsets 1-4 the light source is gradually moved along the horizon. Subset 0 will serve as the training set, while subsets 1-4 are used for testing.**\n",

In this exercise j is an integer between 1 and 10), the test samples S (amatrix composed of vectorized pictures from subsets 1-4) and the corresponding labels (in a separate vector), the 20 singular vectors from the first step, and the parameter k that denotes how many of the PCs are used. Use the Euclidean distance to classify each sample image based on its three nearest neighbors. (This is done by comparing the test samples with the training samples in the reduced space.) As an output give the fraction of images from S that were misclassified, i.e., the error rate. Repeat this for subsets 1 through 4 and for k = 1; : : : ; 20. Plot the error rate for each subset.**"
